- **Django 5.2.3**: Web framework for rapid development and clean design.
- **SQLite**: Default lightweight database for development.
- **Django Admin**: Built-in admin interface for managing users and models.
- **Custom User Model**: Flexible user attributes and authentication (`accounts/models.py`).
- **Django Forms**: For user registration and profile updates.
- **Django Email Backend (Console)**: Prints verification emails to the console for development/testing.
- **HTML Templates**: For user-facing pages (registration, profile, dashboard).
- **Branching**: The main branch is called `master`.

  The navigation bar highlights the current page for better user experience.

- **Bug Fixes:**  
  - Fixed template inheritance issues (`extends`).
  - Corrected Django template syntax for navigation highlighting.

## Email Verification

- After registration, a verification link is printed to the console.
- Copy and paste the link into your browser to activate your account.

---

## Customization

- **User Model**: [`accounts.models.CustomUser`](accounts/models.py)
- **Forms**: [`accounts.forms`](accounts/forms.py)
- **Views**: [`accounts.views`](accounts/views.py)
- **URLs**: [`user_mgmt.urls`](user_mgmt/urls.py), [`accounts.urls`](accounts/urls.py)

---

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure you are using Python 3.x.
- If you encounter issues with migrations, try deleting the `db.sqlite3` file and the `migrations/` folders (except `__init__.py`), then re-run migrations.
- For email verification in production, configure Django's email backend in `settings.py`.
